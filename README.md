# julep-workflow

## TODO
Build a workflow that, for a list of cities:
- Check today's weather and suggest either indoor or outdoor dining.
- Pick 3 iconic local dishes per city.
- Find top-rated restaurants serving these dishes.
- Creates a delightful one-day “foodie tour,” crafting breakfast, lunch, and dinner narratives that factor in weather conditions.
